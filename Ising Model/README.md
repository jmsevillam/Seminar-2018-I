# Ising Model
Programming Seminar 2018 - 01

In the folder [codes](https://github.com/jmsevillam/Seminar/tree/master/Ising%20Model/codes), you can find the programs on `python` and `C++` for an ising model at a temperature which is fixed. Meanwhile on [Temperature](https://github.com/jmsevillam/Seminar/tree/master/Ising%20Model/Temperatures) running the bash scrips `Temperature/script.sh` or `Temperature/C/scripta.sh` a cycle over temperatures is done.

Finally running `analysis.py`, the plot of magnetization per site and susceptibility are done.
